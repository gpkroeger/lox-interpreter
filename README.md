This is a lox interpreter in python

Authors: Gabe Kroeger and Owen Russell

TESTING NOTES:
To run a test outside of our GUI, please run one of the files in the test folder with this command:

    python3 main.py > <name of .lox file>

For ease of use, you can run our GUI by:

    py app.py

or

    python3 app.py

This will open our GUI, here you can mess around with our provided test programs in the tests directory, or run your own LOX programs.
